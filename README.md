# SED-DEV Project

This is the main repository for the SED-DEV project for Avaloq.

We are making an Event Sourcing system based around Apache Kafka.


NOTE: the only things stored here are:
  - Deployment code
  - General notes/snippets
  - archives
  - general issues relating to the whole project

**Code should probably have it's own repo...**
